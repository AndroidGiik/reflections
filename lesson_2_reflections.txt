Christian's Version Control Lesson 2 Reflections

1) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A hidden directory .git is being created. I guess this will be required to track the files that should be under version control in this git repository.

2) How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is for collecting files being added from the working directory to the git repository. It is like a preparation stage before finally making a commit to the repository.

3) How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Only add those modified files to the staging area which belong to a single logical change.
