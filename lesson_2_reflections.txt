Christian's Version Control Lesson 2 Reflections

1) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A hidden directory .git is being created. I guess this will be required to track the files that should be under version control in this git repository.

2) How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is for collecting files being added from the working directory to the git repository. It is like a preparation stage before finally making a commit to the repository.

3) How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Only add those modified files to the staging area which belong to a single logical change.

4) What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Branches could be used to experiement with new ideas or break a bigger project into smaller pieces, so the master branch would always be uncluttered and functional.

5) How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

It visualizes the relationship between the commits in a tree like structure so you can easely judge the position of a single commit and the reachability of other commits from there.
